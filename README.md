# TextAdventure
Text adventure to try and teach Tom how to code

## Using display_level
The display_level let's you substitute player information into your text.
Some examples can be found in the levels/ folder. The syntax is  as follows:
* `<name>` will replace <name> in your text file with the players name
* `<anynumber>` at the end of a line will pause for that many seconds (int only now)
* `<anything goees here as long as its in the player dict>`

Nothing yet for handling input -- that'll be another thing to handle.
